Manchester United owner the new king of Las Vegas

The Glazer family, who owns Manchester United Football Club, is now the largest shareholder in Caesars Entertainment Corporation. The investment was made through a joint venture between the Glazers and private equity firm Apollo Global Management.

This new development comes as Caesars Entertainment is preparing to emerge from bankruptcy. The company is said to be worth $4.4 billion following its restructuring.

The investment gives the Glazers a 20% ownership stake in the company. This will make them one of the largest shareholders in Caesars Entertainment when it emerges from bankruptcy.

The move comes as a bit of a surprise considering that Manchester United has been struggling on the football pitch in recent years. Some have criticised the family for investing money in casinos rather than football.

Others have praised the move, pointing out that it will give the Glazers a significant financial interest in Caesars Entertainment when it emerges from bankruptcy. This could help to ensure that the company is successful following its restructuring.

#  Manchester City owner denies claims he is buying MGM casino

Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour denies claims he is buying the MGM casino in Las Vegas.

The sheikh, who also owns Manchester City football club, has been linked with a $5 billion (£3.8 billion) takeover of the casino group.

However, sources close to the sheikh have told The Times that there is no truth in the rumours.

They said: "Sheikh Mansour has no plans to purchase MGM and this is not something he is focused on."

The denial comes after reports in the US media claimed that MGM executives had met with Sheikh Mansour to discuss the purchase.

MGM Resorts International is one of the largest casino operators in the world, with properties in Nevada, Macau and Singapore.

#  Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham all eyeing up MGM casino in Las Vegas

Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham are all eyeing up a move for the MGM casino in Las Vegas as they look to bolster their income.

The MGM casino is one of the most lucrative and popular casinos in the world, and all three clubs are keen to get their hands on a slice of the action.

The casino is thought to be worth around £4 billion, and all three clubs believe that it could provide a major boost to their bottom line.

Chelsea were believed to be leading the race for the casino, but they have now been joined by Arsenal and Tottenham in the hunt for the property.

MGM are thought to be keen to sell the casino, and all three clubs are likely to face competition from other buyers.

The casino is seen as an attractive proposition due to its high value and its potential to generate significant profits.

#  Liverpool owner interested in bidding for MGM casino

Liverpool FC owner John W. Henry is said to be interested in bidding for the MGM casino in Springfield, Massachusetts, according to local media reports.

MGM Springfield, which is due to open in August this year, is a $960 million dollar project that will create thousands of jobs and is expected to generate over $200 million in annual economic impact for the region.

Henry already has a successful track record as an entrepreneur involved in the gaming industry, owning the Boston Red Sox and a gaming company called Rush Street Gaming.

If successful, Henry's bid would see him become the first major sports team owner to also own a casino.

The news comes at a time when casinos across the United States are facing increasing competition from new forms of gambling such as online poker and sports betting.

#  Premier League owners go head-to-head in race to own MGM casino

The Premier League is awash with cash after a new TV rights deal was agreed last year, and several of the league's biggest owners are now in a race to own a piece of MGM casino.

John W. Henry, the owner of Liverpool and Fenway Sports Group, is leading the charge, and is believed to have already made an offer of $5 billion for the casino company.

Sheikh Mansour, who owns Manchester City, is also thought to be interested in acquiring MGM, as is Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who owns Chelsea.

The bidding war is expected to reach fever pitch over the coming weeks, and it's likely that any sale will break the record for the most expensive purchase of a casino company.

MGM is currently valued at around $10 billion, but it's thought that the Premier League owners could pay up to $15 billion for it.

One potential stumbling block for some of the buyers could be U.S. anti-trust laws, which could prohibit more than one owner from holding a majority stake in MGM.

However, it's thought that Sheikh Mansour and Roman Abramovich are confident that they can get around these rules by forming a consortium.

The race to own MGM casino will no doubt add an extra layer of intrigue to this season's Premier League title race.
