#  Alan Keating Signs With Cincinnati Bengals

After a successful collegiate career at the University of Notre Dame, Alan Keating has been drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the fourth round of the 2019 NFL Draft.

Keating, a 6-foot-3, 313-pound offensive lineman, was a three-year starter for the Irish. He played in all 51 games of his collegiate career and was named second-team All-ACC as a senior.

The Bengals had an immediate need for an offensive lineman after losing left tackle Cordy Glenn to free agency earlier this offseason. With Keating now on the roster, he could compete for the starting job at left guard or right tackle.

Keating is looking forward to starting his NFL career in Cincinnati. “I’m really excited to be a part of the Bengals organization,” Keating said. “It’s an amazing opportunity and I can’t wait to get started. I know there’s a lot of work to be done, but I’m up for the challenge and I’ll do whatever it takes to help this team win.”

Bengals coach Zac Taylor is also excited about Keating’s arrival. “We are thrilled to add Alan to our team,” Taylor said. “He is an excellent player with a tremendous amount of upside. He has great size and athleticism and he plays with a lot of aggression. We are confident that he will be a valuable asset to our offense and contribute to our success in 2019 and beyond.”
