#  Zappos to Offer Shoe Discounts in Las Vegas Casino

Zappos, a popular online shoe and clothing retailer, is set to offer discounts on shoes in the Venetian Casino Resort in Las Vegas. The company announced the new initiative on Wednesday, stating that it is looking to expand its brick-and-mortar presence.

The discounts will be offered at the Zappos store located inside the casino resort and will include a variety of shoes for both men and women. Shoppers will be able to save between 10% and 50% on select styles.

In addition to the discounts, Zappos is also planning a series of events at the store throughout the year. These events will include trunk shows, meet-and-greets with brand ambassadors, and product launches.

This is not Zappos’ first foray into physical stores. The company opened its first brick-and-mortar location in downtown Las Vegas in late 2017. It has also been expanding its presence in other markets, including Los Angeles and Chicago.

Zappos’ decision to offer shoe discounts in Las Vegas comes as no surprise. The city is known for its high concentration of casinos and resorts, making it a prime destination for tourists. In fact, the Venetian Casino Resort is one of the most visited destinations in Las Vegas.

Zappos’ move also reflects the growing popularity of online retailers moving into physical stores. Amazon, for example, has been investing heavily in brick-and-mortar locations over the past few years. This trend is likely to continue as these companies look to increase their market share and customer base.

#  Zappos Invests in Las Vegas Casino Gaming Company

Zappos, the online shoe and clothing retailer, has announced a strategic investment in Las Vegas-based casino gaming company, Wynn Resorts. The move is part of Zappos’s plan to branch out beyond its core ecommerce business and into new verticals.

Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos, stated that the investment was a “natural extension” for the company and would help it tap into the $40 billion global gaming market. Wynn Resorts is one of the largest casino operators in the world and owns and operates several high-profile properties including the Wynn and Encore casinos in Las Vegas.

Zappos is no stranger to investing in businesses outside of its core ecommerce operations. The company has made strategic investments in a number of companies over the years, including online grocery delivery service FreshDirect and social media platform Reddit.

In addition to its investment in Wynn Resorts, Zappos has also made a number of acquisitions in recent years to expand its business. In 2016, the company acquired Italian online fashion retailer Yoox Net-A-Porter for $2 billion. And in 2017, it acquired online shoe retailer Shoes.com for an undisclosed amount.

With its latest investment in Wynn Resorts, Zappos is looking to tap into the growing market for casino gaming. According to industry analysts, global revenues from casino gaming are expected to reach $40.3 billion by 2020. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 5%.

The casino gaming market is currently dominated by a handful of large players such as Las Vegas Sands Corp., MGM Resorts International, and Caesars Entertainment Corp. However, with its expansive network of properties and strong brand name, Wynn Resorts is well positioned to compete in this space.

Zappos’s investment in Wynn Resorts is an indication that the company is looking to expand beyond its core ecommerce operations and into new verticals. Casino gaming represents a huge opportunity for Zappos and it will be interesting to see how the company expands further into this market
