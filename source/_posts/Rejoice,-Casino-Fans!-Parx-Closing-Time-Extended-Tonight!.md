#  Rejoice, Casino Fans! Parx Closing Time Extended Tonight!

Following the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Boardâ€™s decision to extend the hours of operation at Parx Casino in Bensalem, PA, casino fans are rejoicing! This means that Parx Casino will be open until 4am rather than 2am.

The extension of hours at Parx Casino is great news for both casino fans and the economy of Bucks County, PA. extended hours at Parx Casino will create a total of 64 new jobs and bring an additional $1.6 million in revenue to the county each year.

Casino gaming is a vital part of the economy in Bucks County and this extension of hours at Parx Casino will go a long way in helping to support local businesses and create jobs. We applaud the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board for making this decision and we encourage casino fans to take advantage of the extended hours this evening!

#  Lucky Gamblers Get Another Hour at Parx Casino Tonight!

There will be an extra hour of gambling at Parx Casino in the Bensalem area tonight. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board has announced that the casino can stay open until 2 am. This is because the board has approved an increase in the number of slot machines at the casino from 2,906 to 3,206.

The board made this decision after studying how much revenue is generated by casinos versus how much they contribute to the state. The study found that each casino generates on average $21 million in tax revenue, but costs the state $32 million in expenditures. This leaves a net loss of $11 million for the state.

#  Parx Casino Closing Time Extended to Midnight Tonight!

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board announced today that the Parx Casino in Bensalem will be allowed to stay open until midnight tonight. This decision was made in order to allow residents of the area to enjoy one last weekend of gambling at the casino before it closes its doors for good.

This closure is a result of Pennsylvania's new gambling law, which prohibits casinos from operating within 75 miles of each other. Parx Casino is located just 76 miles away from Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem, and as a result, it must close its doors by September 30th.

The Parx Casino has been a staple of the Bensalem community for over 10 years, and many residents are sad to see it go. Some are even protesting the closure, arguing that it will have a negative impact on the local economy.

Others are looking forward to the opening of Valley Forge Casino Resort, which is set to open in late 2018. Valley Forge is located just 34 miles away from Parx Casino, so it will not be affected by the new gambling law.

#  Woo-Hoo! Parx Casino staying open an extra hour tonight!

The 17th of November, 2017 is a great day for Parx Casino customers living in the Bensalem Township. This is because the casino will be open an extra hour tonight! This means that gamblers will be able to enjoy all their favorite casino games an additional hour.

Parx Casino made this announcement on their social media platforms earlier today. They advised that the casino would be open from 7am until 2am. This extension is especially welcome news for those who work long hours and may not have been able to make it to the casino during its regular operating hours.

The extension comes hot on the heels of news that Parx had scooped up three major awards at this year's PlayPennsylvania Gaming Congress. These accolades include "Casino of the Year Award," "Best Slot Floor Award," and "Best Overall Gaming Experience Award."

With these awards in hand, as well as the extension announced today, Parx Casino is looking forward to a very successful future!
