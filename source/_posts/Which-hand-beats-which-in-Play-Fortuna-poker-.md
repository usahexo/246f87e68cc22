#  Which hand beats which in Play Fortuna poker? 

If you are a beginner in Play Fortuna poker, it is important to learn which hand beats which. In this article, we will take a look at all possible scenarios.

The following list shows the order of hands from strongest to weakest:

1. Royal flush
2. Straight flush
3. Four of a kind
4. Full house
5. Flush
6. Straight
7. Three of a kind
8. Two pairs
9. One pair
10. High card

  Let's start with the most basic scenario - two players have the same rank card. In this case, the player with the higher second-highest card wins. For example, if both players have an Ace, the player with the King would win. If both players have the same two highest cards, then the third highest card would determine the winner.     Now let's move on to more complex scenarios! 
     Suppose you are playing against one opponent and you both have three of a kind. In this scenario, the player with the higher fourth card would win. For example, if both players have three of a kind Aces, but one player has a 4 while the other has a 2, then the player with the 4 would win. If both players have three of a kind Kings, then it would go to the fifth card to determine a winner - and so on... 

 Suppose you are playing against two opponents and you all have three of a kind. In this scenario, the player with the highest triplet would win - so for example, if one player has three Kings, one player has three Queens and one player has three Jacks, then the player with three Kings would win! If there is still a tie after looking at each triplet individually, then it would go to the second-highest triplet to determine a winner (eighth card). And so on...

#  Texas Hold'em Poker – What hands beat what? 

Texas hold'em poker is one of the most popular poker variants in the world. The game is played with a deck of 52 cards, and the aim of the game is to make the best five-card hand using any combination of the two cards in your hand and the five community cards on the table.

In Texas hold'em poker, there are 10 possible combinations (or hands) that can be made, ranked from worst to best:

1. High card – This is any hand that doesn't contain a pair or better. The highest card in the hand determines the rank of the hand. So, for example, if you are dealt an Ace, a 2 and a 3, your highest card is an Ace and your hand would rank as a high card. 
2. Pair – This is two cards of the same rank. The rank of the pair determines the rank of the hand. So, for example, if you are dealt two Kings, your pair would rank as a pair of Kings and your hand would beat any other hand that doesn't have a pair or better. 
3. Two pairs – This is two pairs of different ranks. The rank of the two pairs determines the rank of the hand. So, for example, if you are dealt two Kings and two 2s, your two pairs would be 2s and Kings, and your hand would beat any other hand that doesn't have three pairs or better. 
4. Three of a kind – This is three cards of the same rank. The rank of the three-of-a-kind determines the rank of the hand. So, for example, if you are dealt three 5s, your three-of-a-kind would rank as a three-of-a-kind 5s and your hand would beat any other hand that doesn't have four-of-a-kind or better. 
5. Straight – This is five consecutive cards ranked from lowest to highest (e.g. Ace through 5). The Ace can be either high or low (Aces are low) but it cannot be used twice in succession (e.g A♣ 2♦ 3♥ 4♠ 5♦ is not a straight). 
6. Flush – This is five cards all of the same suit (e.g clubs). If two players have flushes then the one with higher ranking cards wins (eldest first). If both players have identical high ranking cards then play proceeds to second highest ranking card etc 
7/8/9/10 = Same as 6


7/8/9/10 = Same as 6

#  How to play poker - understanding poker hand rankings

Understanding poker hand rankings is one of the first steps to learning how to play poker. The order of hands is key to being able to make the best decision for your hand, whether you're playing in a casino or online.

There are five different types of hands in poker - high card, one pair, two pair, three of a kind, and four of a kind. Each type of hand is ranked based on its value, with the highest value being the royal flush.

A high card hand is made up of any five cards that don't fit into any other category. The highest ranking card is the winner of the hand. If two players have the same high card, then the second-highest ranking card would be used to break the tie.

One pair consists of two cards of the same rank. The rank of the pair determines the winner of the hand - with two Aces taking down any other pair. If both players have a pair, then the highest ranking post-flop kicker would determine who wins. For example, if one player has two Kings and another has two Queens, the player with two Kings would win as their second highest card (a Jack) would beat out Queen high.

Two pair consists of two different pairs of cards. The rank of each individual pair still determines who wins, just like in one pair hands. If both players have two pairs, then the fifth card (the kicker) would determine who wins.

Three of a kind consists of three cards of the same rank. Again, this rank determines who takes down the pot. If both players have three-of-a-kinds then it's determined by whoever has the highest kicker card (again).

Four of a kind consist of four cards all with the same rank. This obviously takes down any other hand and is therefore an automatic winning hand - no need for further calculation!
